Selecting DOM elements
D3 makes manipulating the DOM easy. For example, letâ€™s try to change all <p&gt;</p> -elements to have an inline style setting the color to blue.

d3.selectAll("p").style("color", "blue")

The .selectAll()-method allows us to select all elements of a specific type. We can also use .select() to select individual nodes.

The React library also manipulates the DOM. This means we have to make a little extra effort to get it to work together with D3. Luckily React already has a solution for allowing targeting and updating DOM elements. To do this, React uses references.
